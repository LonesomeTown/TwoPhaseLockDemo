# TwoPhaseLockDemo
1. This programming assignment is divided into two projects, the 'base', and the 'bonus'.
2. The files with .java suffix are the source files and the files with .class suffix are the compiled files.
3. You may need to modify the source file with the .java suffix, after that, please execute ‘javac Main.java’ to compile the file.
4. Please also execute ‘javac Main.java’ to compile files before running it.
5. For the .txt files which need to be read, please put them in the root path of the project (i.e. /base or /bonus).
6. When you need to run the program, go to the project root path (i.e. /base or /bonus), and execute a command for example: 'java Main 3 t1.txt t2.txt t3.txt t4.txt'
